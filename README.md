This is my personal **React learning repository**.  
Each branch represents progress on different tasks, small projects, or concepts I've been working on. It's also my **own database of reusable components and custom hooks**.

- Beginner to intermediate **React components**
- Practice with **props**, **state**, and **hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.)
- Simple **project-based learning** (e.g., to-do list, counter, form handling)
- Clean and readable code with comments for learning purposes
